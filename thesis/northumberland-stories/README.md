# Exploring health inequalities through storytelling in Northumberland
This is the code respository for collecting insight and stories unearthed as part of my 2021/22 MRes Healthcare & Design thesis, for the Royal College of Art. It is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document), that hopefully documents the path I took to submitting it. 

> **We love stories**
> 
> Everybody has a story. 
> Ordinary stories, extraordinary stories, stories that delight, entertain, educate, stories that make you laugh, think, hope and cry. stories are the raw material from which we live our lives.

## Credit & attribution
The original code was taken from the **Exploring local income deprivation** scrollytelling article published by the Office for National Statistics. The article can be [read here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1371/), but hacked to allow for the story to centre on Northumberland and their local wards and the people that live in them. 

The article was built using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) javascript framework, [Mapbox GL JS (v1)](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)* and the [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics/) charting library. It is based on [this scrollytelling template](https://github.com/ONSvisual/svelte-scrolly/).

(*Note that Mapbox GL JS v2 is no longer open source. This repository relies on v1.13.1. [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js), an open source fork of Mapbox GL JS v1 with ongoing community support, is also available.)
